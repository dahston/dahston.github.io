So Running club v 2 was a disaster today! I went yesterday because the directors couldn't go today - but some of the guys in the office have taken to 'walking club' and I decided to join them today, we set off at 15:30 and within 2 minutes, the heavens opened and we all got fucking WRECKED. It took like 30 seconds to run back to the office but the damage was done, soaked to the bone. It was pretty hilarious because by 16:00 it was beautiful and sunny outside.

I think that's God punishing me for deigning to walk instead of run, lesson learned big guy...
