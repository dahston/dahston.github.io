Amazon gave me 3 free months of Amazon Music Unlimited - quite happy with that as it means I can continue my trend of playing Tranquility Base to DEATH, now I can do it on the move!

For someone who loves music so much, I spend ridiculously long periods of time not listening to any at all, sometimes. I'm sure there's a correlation with these periods and feeling down.

So this is pretty cool because it's really convenient to download stuff for offline play. Ok I feel like i'm advertising for Amazon now and they don't need it!

Had a nice lunch time chat with my mum today, she's got a new lead for the dog that goes around the waist that she's pretty chuffed with. She said sometimes, if for example another dog approaches, she might have a tendency to get a little tense, and that tension travels through her hand into the lead and into the dog! Potentially causing the dog to become tense! Makes sense to me, and this lead should take that out of the equation. I think it's a very scientific approach and I commend her! 

I said I would book a monday off sometime soon, and spend the weekend at hers - that would be really lovely. I haven't even met her dog. Will keep you posted!

Running club a day early today because some of the guys can't make it tomorrow, felt REALLY good - had a lovely chat with Jon Keegan throughout though he did not seem to be enjoying the running aspect as much as I was, with about half a mile to go he said he definitely would have stopped if he was running solo. THat made me feel good in all sorts of ways. A. Me (and the other members of running club) were motivation enough to push through and finish the job! and B. It made me feel like even for the short amount of time I've been following this training plan (I'm on week 2, slow down Dan...) i'm definitely getting benefits out of it!

It wasn't my fastest run of running club but it felt comfortable and fun and enjoyable to talk with Jon, I hope I didn't just talk his ear off! He recommended a film 'Sorry To Bother You' - gonna check it out and i'll do my VERY FIRST movie review, right here. It's all very fucking exciting!
