It's been a while, again. I work in a pub, I met cool new people who've enriched my life some (shoutout to Jess).

Don't want to write a whole essay about my intentions going forward, I've been here before. What i am going to do though is try to hold myself accountable and keep checking in here, even if things start to get bad. 

I stopped smoking 6 days ago, i've been running as much as i can and i'm going to the gym with Andy today. I know all these things are landmarks on the 'right' track, I just have to stay on it.

I have a session with Sallie tomorrow for the first time in what feels like years, I miss speaking with her.
