I can't think of anything in particular to write today. It's felt a bit like an up hill battle since I got out of bed, I think I did the right sort of things:
+ I went to the gym
+ I ran
+ I went for a walk like 6 times
+ I listened to some music in the afternoon and played a little guitar
+ I called my mum, that was nice. I really miss her. I don't talk to her enough, or anyone

But I still feel like I'm just keeping the negative thoughts temporarily at bay, nothing felt like a victory today, just a brief respite.

I need to come to terms with the fact that I'm clearly feeling lonely, and yet I'm constantly pushing people away, shutting them out and eroding relationships. I think I've convinced myself, whether it's true or not, that nobody really likes me. My only explanation right now for the way that I am is that I think people dislike me, or that they will dislike me if they get to know me more. So I don't give them the opportunity, or just act aloof.

I can tell myself that I don't need people, but I'm a human being, we're social animals and my emotional ups and downs this weekend have kind of demonstrated to me that I'm a fucking lunatic and I need to check in with society on occasion!

Something i'd like to work on next week, is setting an agenda for my days, especially the weekend. I think a lot of the difficulty was just not knowing what to do with myself, and feeling too low in that moment to spontaneously pick something to do. There's no shortage of things I'd like to achieve! So next week I will try to come up with some kind of agenda, I'll record it here when I come up with it.

Random thought... Every post I write, I'm struck with how much I use "I/I'm". Even in this line!! I can't escape it! I'm sure it's normal for writing of this type, I'm not used to writing about my feelings and it's probably just a consequence of the fact that I'm writing about *myself*. It feels really fucking corny though And I can't shake the feeling I'm writing wrong... somehow..
