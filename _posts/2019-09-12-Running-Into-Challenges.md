I signed up for the Tatton Park Half Marathon with my brother! It's on Sunday 3rd November which gives me 52 days to prepare, or 7.4 weeks! I'm a little nervous, but more than that I'm just really excited. I think having something to train for that's not too far off in the future is just what I need.

#### Training Plan
Because I have a tendency to overthink things, I'm really trying to do the opposite here. I'm going to spend the first 4 weeks increasing my weekly mileage from around 5 right now, to 15-20. In the last few weeks I will run less frequently but for longer distances. In the few days before the event I will run very little if at all. And we'll see what happens!
That's probably not a very good training plan. But it's a start, I can review how it goes and iterate!

I'm also quitting smoking (as of yesterday) - that should help if I can stick to it! 

#### Walk The Line
I spent a good 2 hours last night just trying to strum and sing along to Johnny Cash, my fingers really hurt now. It's super relaxing even though my chord changes are still too slow. I'll keep working on it, this is the first time i've been able to 'sort of' sing along while trying to play. Obviously I still sound like complete ass, but it's all music to my ears.

#### Sleep!
I got really sick of my terrible bed last night, it dips heavily in the middle and it can NOT be good for me - so I dragged the mattress into the living room and had such a good nights sleep. While it took me a little while to drift off, when I woke up I felt SO refreshed. I actually think that I will try without the mattress soon, apparently there are many health benefits from sleeping on a hard surface - I found some Japanese Tatami style sleeping mats on [Amazon][tatami], I'm going to think on it some more and maybe buy one.
