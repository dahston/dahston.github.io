5 mile run today! Intervals of 3 minutes 'fast' and then 3 minutes slow, it kicked my arse but god damn do I feel good now, not good in a literal sense, I feel bloody awful... But good in a floaty, giddy, prideful sort of way!

Had a nice chat about anime with Ros today, turns out we're both secret weebs, or wannabe weebs - I'm not sure i'm worthy of the weeb title but fuck I want to be! I actually got really pumped to watch a bunch of stuff i've been meaning to this weekend. I mean, i never finished FMA: Brotherhood, and I've always kind of wanted to check out Neon Genesis Evangelion because of it's reputation... I think it might be a job for Sunday evening!

I was planning to go to Runners Need tomorrow to get my shoes, but it turns out the Run North West store in Hyde is closing down and having a big sale. So i'm gonna make my way there instead and see if I can snag a bargain!

Looking forward to breakfast with Laura on Sunday! Signing off now because I need to eat before I fall asleep right here...exhausted!
