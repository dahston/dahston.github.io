I went too fast in running club today, after telling myself I would take it easy.. I ended up running faster than I have all year... doh!

I said it before but I gotta be careful, I iced the top of my foot afterwards as it's kind of sore. Need to pay more attention to my body!

Despite telling myself off above, running club was great! Really enjoying the communal aspect of it, huge props to Andy for allowing it to take place during company time (Though I finish at 4 anyway so it's my time! :p)

Laura got in touch just after I got home, I walked down to the bus station to meet her and we went for an impromptu curry - It was such a great idea, I really enjoyed myself and also really glad I could be there because she was clearly feeling kind of meh and didn't want to just go home and think about more work. I totally understand, I was grateful for the opportunity to get out as well. We still have a date on Saturday, too!

I had my annual review today, I got some really positive feedback from Anna and I know what I need to do. My skills are fine, It's my time management that I need to work on. I need to get in control of my projects. I remember reading GTD back in the day, I still have a copy. I think I will give it another go.
