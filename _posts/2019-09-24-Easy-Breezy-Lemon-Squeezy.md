5 miles today! Felt comfortable and strong, maybe a little tight in my inside ankles towards the end but not to a point that I worried. Running club tomorrow! I can't wait, the running has got me...

Me and Laura are going for breakfast on Sunday, she's working so hard - I'm super proud of her and looking forward to catching up over some tasty food :) Will update with what I ate, I know that's what my audience wants ^_^

Other news.... let's see - I don't know! I'm really happy recently, feel like I'm literally bursting with joy at times (ha, gaaayyyyyyyy). It feels good, it feels really fucking good.
