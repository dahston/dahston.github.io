I managed to stay on track with my intentions yesterday, it felt really good to stick to my guns and I was able to do some much needed cleaning, practise guitar and I was even able to get out for a run, **nice**!

It's not news to me that excercise makes me feel much better all round, I think it's in forgetting that feeling. Losing my motivation and slowly regressing into an unfit state where I don't recall the way I felt when I was treating my body with respect.

I think the key, then, lies in routinely reviewing my progress, and looking back at my initial intentions. If I can reconcile the way i feel at any given moment in the future, with the way that I felt when I set out my goals, then I can avoid slipping backwards and losing my progress.

I'm re-reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. There is so much value in this text written almost 2,000 years ago that it's kind of unreal, if it wasn't for the language used, i could easily imagine Marcus Aurelius to exist in modern times.
It's fascinating to see that people of those times tended to worry about the exact same types of things that we worry about today.

As far as i know, the books were written without any intention of publication, and the text reads very much as though Marcus Aurelius is talking to his future self - recording what he knew to be true for no other purpose than to revisit it later, so that he may be reminded of what he knows to be true.

 *And funnily enough, that's what I intend to do here...*
