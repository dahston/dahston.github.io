# 2022. Start Again.

It's 2022 - I won't get into Christmas + New Year because it was a sorry state of affairs, it wasn't a great time to be in my head.

Attempting 30 days of yoga with Gem starting today, and i've been running for the past couple of days also. 

I ~~suppose~~ have decided that I ~~should~~ **will** try for a full year, from beginning to end, to make a new life.
