Today was a good day, I didn't struggle with anxiety or stress too much, I didn't crave a cigarette and I didn't get depressed when I got home from work! That's a win in my book!

I intentionally had a really chilled evening, my training plan has me resting today so I played the new Risk Of Rain 2 update with Beeby, Pete & Chris - it was a blast, there's something to be said about this casual gaming stuff... Not wanting to blow your brains out after a game is a pretty novel experience!

I don't have much else to say today, I had things under control today, and it felt GOOD. I'm happy. I'm working towards my goals, I'm not feeling overwhelmed and I'm not overthinking things (too much!). Go me.

Here's to 10,000 more days like this, nothing special, just me, in control of my life.
