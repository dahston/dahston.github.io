So I woke up today and my foot felt pretty good, but my calf was SO tight! It was crazy, as though the injury had travelled from my ankle, up my leg into the calf! This was great news though as it was now located in a muscle, which I can stretch! So I got my running gear on and walked down to the river (to make sure the pain didn't return after putting weight on my foot) and it all felt okay, I smashed out 6.2 miles and it felt awesome to have done it! I'm hoping that I don't wake up tomorrow in incredible pain, but I'm feeling optimistic.

Overall this was a really great weekend, I've barely even considered smoking, or thought to myself that I'm missing anything.

I did intend to work this weekend though, and I haven't at all. I have obligations to both Calvin & Astra tomorrow and I'm not quite sure how I'm going to meet them now. All I can do at this point is to try my best to work hard tomorrow and remain focused. I'm going to take myself off into the glass office first thing and just drill away at my work.

Found a yoga class that takes place every Friday at 6pm, I think I want to check it out this week!

Oh, last thing... I bought some chia seeds on a whim, soaked some in water and drank after my run, really strange experience as they swell up so much, they absorb something like 20 times their weight in water and the drink turns into a kind of gel. They are supposedly a superfood and also amazing for digestion, so, we'll see!
