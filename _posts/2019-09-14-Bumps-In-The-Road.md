I did the Bramhall ParkRun this morning with Phil and Calvin - it was great fun! I got a time of 26:56, massive scope for improvement! Planning to run it again (or another ParkRun) next Saturday.

Things started to go a bit downhill after that, when I arrived home I sort of became overwhelmed at... something, I don't exactly know what. I played a game of DoTA with Purcy, in which i was just **SO** angry, I'm actually embarrassed, although I'm sure Purcy is used to it... Anyway, after the game I could feel my heart racing and I just found it really hard to be present. I think part of me was *trying* to get wound up, so that I would be able to excuse myself for saying 'fuck it' and having a smoke or something similar.

I managed to not do that, thankfully. Instead I showered, got dressed and forced myself out of the house - I went into town for a wander and to be around people. I bought some household crap like shower gel and some multi-vitamins, and then I came back. Nothing too groundbreaking, but it was enough to calm myself down enough to where I wasn't shaking involuntarily.

### What did I learn from my experience today?
I'm proud of myself for recognising my feelings, acknowledging them and making a plan to do something about it. It's important to stay vigilant and aware of how I'm feeling, it's too easy to slip into a negative headspace, and even easier to go into a downward spiral once you're there. I also spoke to Laura about how I was feeling, and she really helped to calm me down. She has her own things going on, though, and I don't want to burden her (Though I know she doesn't see it that way, it's just because she's such a wonderful person)

I think it's also important to acknowledge that even now I don't feel 100% okay, and that's okay. I'm okay with the fact that I don't feel 100% okay right now :)

I feel like i should write more, here, today. But I don't want to force it. I'm happy that I worked up the courage to post anything, this is my first post from home, buffered on both ends with free time that terrifies me.

That's kind of hilarious, to be terrified by free time. But I've spent the better half of the last 15 years running away from myself, doing whatever I could to not have to think, or feel. I guess what I'm saying that it's scary to confront yourself after so many years of avoiding yourself. But I know I can do it. I have to keep reminding myself of the intentions I have laid out, and how I don't want to feel the way I do when I have given up.
