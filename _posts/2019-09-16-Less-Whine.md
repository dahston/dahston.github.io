I read through my posts from this weekend, I was really finding it hard! But I stayed on track and that's the important thing. But I don't want to cry into my blog every day about how difficult things are, life is difficult!

I found a 7 week Half Marathon plan [here][hm] and decided thatit must be perfect for me because that's exactly how long until my HM! Makes sense, right?

I did the 1st run of the plan straight after work, 4.8 miles at an 'easy' pace - it should have been 4 but I'm pretty incredbile so I made it 4.8, no, it was an accident but it felt great to do! I had almost convinced myself not to go after work with some of the lamest excuses, like not having a decent route to do 4 miles, or not wanting to put my keys and phone in the same pocket. I ignored myself though, because my excuses were shite.
