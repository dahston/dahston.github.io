Making a 'self care shelf'. shaving stuff, creams, moisturiser, lip balm n shit

feeling anxious about going for a run
dont feel like doing 5k but anything less feels like a failure
obsessing over 'long enough' to the point where i dont wnt to run

spoke with Sallie today, it's great to talk in these sessions but i'm beginning to realise that only i can really do anything. Sallie isn't going to make my life better, she's helping me... but I have to use the things we find out in my sessions to help myself.

listening to music again, i don't know what happens where i just forget that it exists for months at a time. think its maybe because music brings a lot of emotions. sometimes i do not want that

don't really have any desire to do anything 'hobby' like, i don't think running counts. maybe its more like i dont have the desire to do anything creative - i don't know if that's ok?

want to get high. i don't care about smoking honestly, not smoking in work idc.
but not getting stoned.. scared of sobriety. fucking terrified
