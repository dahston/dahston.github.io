I'm trying to start again, my life in Stockport, with Laura and the cats is over. I don't have any contact with anyone from my old life.

I moved to Thelwall with my sister, i'm doing weekly counselling, and taking prescription anti-depressants. I managed to get a job as an IT systems analyst and I cycle to work most days. I do feel like I died, somewhere in 2020. Not that I necessarily feel 'reborn'... But there's a clear boundary in my mind between my life before and whatever this is.

I have a pretty close friendship with Matt whom I now work with - we relate to each other in a lot of ways, and we're also really different to each other. I'm grateful to have at least one person I feel that I can talk to openly.

I've done 3 Half Marathons now - i'd like to run a full marathon in 2022.
