Ice, Ice baby! So today I am icing my foot again, it hurt on the way to work, it hurt all day, it hurt on the way home... It hurts!

I think it's pretty obviously just strained from overuse, doing a bit too much too fast this week, Phil is still planning to come for the Park Run tomorrow, and while i'm definitely coming with. I *might* just have to walk it, or even just support. It's honestly not *that* bad, but I'm still hoping to do my long run on Sunday, so I want to ease off as much as possible until then, in the hopes that I'll feel good on Sunday.

That's it today. It's Friday, I'm home with not much in the way of bad habits to fill my time. This drove me crazy last weekend, luckily I have a busier few days ahead of me. And as for tonight, well, there are worse things than being a little bored. I'll probably have an early night (old timer). I just want to be as prepared as I can be for November 3rd!
