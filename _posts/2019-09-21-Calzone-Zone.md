Went on a lovely date with Laura today, we walked by the river in the sunshine, listening to music. Took our time on the way into town and had great food. I had the best calzone, made me want to rewatch Parks and Rec...

It was a day well spent! I've been ridiculously happy today despite my foot being a bastard and not being able to run, it's funny, there's nothing more I want to do in the world right now than go and run for an hour!

More ice... More rest... Lot's of work to do tomorrow - the plan is to smash it hard and be super prepared for the week. I can do it, I will do it!
