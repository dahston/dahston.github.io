I returned to work today after a week off. I found myself doing nothing with my days but i couldn't bring myself to drag myself out of the slump.
I did manage to run 5 miles early in the week, that was great but, having done that - I spent the rest of the week feeling like I could laze about..

I've been thinking about what I hope to gain from writing posts here, I've always *intended* to write often, I can see the value in getting your thoughts down on record. Every thought, every insight is fleeting.
I wonder how much I have lost because I did not record it?

I felt bad, this past week. Other than the single run, I didn't challenge myself to anything meaningful, and while I can claim that it's nice to do sweet **fuck all**... it's really not.

With the knowledge that doing nothing doesn't bring me happiness - i'm going to start doing something.

I have goals in health & fitness / music / IT. I also have time. I've been fooling myself into believing that I have better things to do.
But every time I fall into that trap, I realise, too late, that I just wasted a day, a month, a year...

I'm going to throw myself back into training at the gym, learning guitar and working on my professional skills, I will use this blog to hold myself accountable, and keep a record of my progress.
