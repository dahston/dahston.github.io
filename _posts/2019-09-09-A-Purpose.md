I returned to work today after a week off. I found myself doing nothing with my days but i couldn't bring myself to drag myself out of the slump
I did manage to run 5 miles early in the week, that was great but, having done that - i spent the rest of the week feeling like i could laze about..

I've been thinking about what i hope to gain from writing posts here, I've always *intended* to write often, i can see the value in getting your thoughts down on record. Every thought, every insight is fleeting.
I wonder how much i have lost because i did not record it?

I felt bad, this past week. Other than the single run, i didn't challenge myself to anything meaningful, and while i can claim that it's nice to do sweet **fuck all**... it's really not.

With the knowledge that doing nothing doesn't bring me happiness - i'm going to start doing something.

I have goals in health & fitness / music / IT. I also have time. I've been fooling myself into believing that i have better things to do.
But every time i fall into that trap, i realise, too late, that i just wasted a day, a month, a year...

I'm going to throw myself back into training at the gym, learning guitar and improving my professional skills in IT, i will use this blog to hold myself accountable, and hopefully keep a record of my progress.
