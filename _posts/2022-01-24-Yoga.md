Me and Gem have been doing Yoga with Adrienne, we did it this morning at 07:30 before work, it was a great start to the day and i'm looking forward to making it a regular thing..

There's been a 20 day break since my last post, while i've still been running - I took a week off work sick to try and deal with my mental health a little, i spoke to the nurse at my GP and after doing both an autism and ADHD questionnaire she has sent me off a referral to look into this, i'm particularly concerned that i might have ADHD. For the longest time i thought that it was almost 'wishful thinking' to finally have an 'excuse' for being 'lazy'.  But at this point i feel desperate, one thing i've noticed is just how much distress it causes me to not be able to do what i know i need to do. I think if it was just pure laziness, i wouldn't really be that bothered. But I am. I really really am.

When it's at its worst I feel like a prisoner in my mind & body, theres so much of myself that is invisible to me, so much automatic behaviour in an effort to 'protect' myself.

Here are things that help my state of mind:
- Regular exercise - I feel incredible after a long run! Yoga makes me feel connected to my body. Lifting weights makes me feel in control.
- Intentional Actions - this seems vague but really, following through with anything, wether it's tidying my room or putting a wash on. Taking control makes me feel in control- no shit!
- Listening to music - I adore music, who doesn't? But for some reason, i forget it exists for months at a time. There are times when I always have a song in my head. And there are times I don't think of music at all, these times usually coincide with feeling low...
- Spending time with Family - I've been to Bingo with my mum and sisters twice recently, I think i'm going to go regularly. I don't see mum or Jade nearly enough and this is a great way to spend time with them.

Yesterday was my longest run of the year at 11km, i'm loosely following a Half Marathon training plan on Strava - i want to run the Manchester 10k in May with Gem, and set my sights on a half later in the year. 
I'll sign off with a picture i took on a recent run. i like it in B&W - it makes me feel arty.
