I hit the gym after work yesterday but didn't feel too tired once I was home, so after a game of DoTA I decided to run a quick mile while my food was cooking.
It probably helped a little too much because I slept through my alarms and got up around 9 today!

Usually I would feel pretty shitty about this, and instantly it would sap my motivation. But I can clearly see that it was my body responding to the work I made it do. While i've had periods of frequent workouts - this is not one of them (yet!) So it's only natural that I would need some additional recovery time.

So it was a great idea to get out for the additional run, it really helped me to sleep. I should have gone to bed around an hour earlier because I wasted some time on youtube, not nearly as much as usual though!

### Firefly

I've been tinkering with an open-source Personal Finance manager called [Firefly 3][ff3]. Partly because I have a goal to be debt-free by the end of the year, but mainly because I wanted to set up a local web server on my Windows Subsystem for Linux setup. I'm starting to feel comfortable with UNIX and i'm using it for more tasks whenever I can think of a use.
The application itself is pretty cool, this morning I imported a bunch of statements from my bank, it has plenty of features and a slick interface.

It's only running locally on my work laptop at the moment, the next step is to host it, probably on Digital Ocean and link it to this domain so that I can log in anywhere. To do that i need to learn how to deploy it securely, so that should be a fun little challenge!
