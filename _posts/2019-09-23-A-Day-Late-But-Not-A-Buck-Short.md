I'm making this post on the 24th, but I wanted to keep up the streak of daily posts. I'm ok with not posting it on the same day, especially If it wasn't out of laziness, but being busy!

I made an effort to ring my sisters and my dad today - I don't speak to any of my family enough, and in particular my sisters or my dad! It was brilliant to catch up - I got to speak to my little sister Jade, and briefly my niece, Skye - she's started reception already!! I'd like to get closer to my family, my dad was over the moon to have me call him - and I was really happy for having spoken to everyone.

I hit the gym after work and did some light upper body stuff, it was hard NOT to run today - but I wanted to make sure my foot is A-ok, it feels good. Gonna do my easy run tomorrow after work!

I predict that tomorrow, the supreme court will rule that BJ suspended parliament unlawfully, not that i'm posting from the future where the decision has already happened or anything... Fuck you Boris!
